## Welcome to Entrepreneurial Spirit!  
Still in very early development, this app is intended to be a fun educational source for learning how the stock market works. Plans for this app are big. It will feature all of the big stocks (right now only BTC and MSFT are supported but more are on the way). The goal is an app in which you can "invest" in stocks and see how you do, without spending a dime. Of course this is educational and there are no actual stocks being bought here. You are started off with $10k to invest however you please. Stock prices are updated once per hour (while the server is running on your machine), so it is not intended to be a game you sit down and play.
### To get started  
1. clone the repository  
2. install dependencies ('npm install')  
3. run 'npm start'
#### NOTE: This app requires you to have MongoDB installed.
